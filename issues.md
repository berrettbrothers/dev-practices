Issue Management
============

### General Workflow

#### Creating Issues

Assign issue to a milestone if you know it belongs to one. 
Assign priority (1 - least important, 3 - most important)
Assign difficulty (1 - least difficult, 3 - most difficult)
Tag issue type, e.g. feature, bug

#### Completing Issues

Do not use words like "closes" or "fixes". At the point when issues are closed, we still haven't pulled them for review on the branch we deploy to a staging/QA system.

#### Pull Requests

Assign Pull Request to the appropriate GitHub Milestone so we can do quality assurance for all the issues on a particular iteration.
Use the [correct syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages) to close issues with your pull request

#### Commit Messages
