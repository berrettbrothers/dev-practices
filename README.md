Development Practices
=============

This repository houses a living set of documents for standardized software development practices in the organization. All members of the development team are encouraged to make changes to the documents in this repository as they learn more about what does and doesn't work when collaborating with one another. The broad purpose of these documents is to create a pleasant and unobtrusive development workflow that produces the best possible code. Happy developers are productive developers. With that in mind, the next section outlines some more specific goals to guide the creation of these standards.

### Goals

- Produce clean, consistent code
- Utilize simple, repeatable development processes
- Reduce wasted time and effort
- Simplify developer communication and interaction
- Eliminate confusion and frustration
